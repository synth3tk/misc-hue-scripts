# misc-hue-scripts
Personal stash of Python Philips Hue scripts. Like beefed-up scenes.

##READ THIS PART:
This is literally just a "braindump" from my home automation server, not something that I expect anyone to clone or use verbatim. I'm providing these publically as a sort of backup for myself and also to help anyone out who may need a few lines here-or-there.

The scripts require [phue](https://github.com/studioimaginaire/phue) to be installed globally and assumes that you're smart-enough to get initial setup working. If you need help, feel free to send me a [chirp on the Tweeters](https://twitter.com/synth3tk).
