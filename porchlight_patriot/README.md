**What Do?**

Rotates from white to red to blue. Stays on each color for 8 seconds, with a 3-second transition period. Should theoretically be 5-seconds of pure color time, but I don't know count. Brightness is set to 80.

It also handles exiting gracefully by turning the light off when it receives a SIGINT or SIGTERM.

Oh, and it has less-than-informative logging! State-of-the-art! Hyphens-hype!

**Why?!**

Originally created to show support for France, but will also work well for America's favorite holidays.

**To-do-doo**

* Move more variables to variables because why wouldn't I?
* Ponder whether or not I care that this is such a hacky solution

**The name?**

If you're offended by the name, too bad.
